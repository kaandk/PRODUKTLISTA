- Second install the *JSON to Figma* [plugin here.](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/789839703871161985/JSON-to-Figma) I think you can use whatever JSON Figma plugin you want, this is just the one I've used for testing.


### How to use in Figma:
- Open the plugin by right clicking anywhere on your canvas, then open *JSON to Figma* ![](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/2ibdq5xwqwgs449/Screenshot%202020-08-27%20at%2020.22.32.png?dl=0)

- Now click the *From local file* button and open the JSON file you want to use.

- Select the Product Component you want to populate and click *Populate all matches* - Make sure *By layer name* is selected. ![](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/rziha3a19gfde4b/Screenshot%202020-08-27%20at%2020.27.20.png?dl=0)

- Click *Reset* if you want to load a new JSON file.



*FYI: The current version has a problem where it doesn't change the image in Product list components from the **App library***
